### Pattern concept

Because all new browsers supporting, Service Workers. We can take Isomorphic app concept. On first load, and if browsers not Support Service workers we will fetch data from network.
 
For Browsers who are supporting Service workers, fetch event will catch by them. Means no unnecessary network request. 
Client will work with `innerHtml` all JSON data manipulation, will be Service worker and Server job. Any interested element, will be tagged by unique id.
This id will pass to service, service will find particular request, and respond with necessary value.

All animations, will handle by css3 features. Instead of manipulating DOM, we will rerender full block. Any dom Event wil handle by container `element` and request to fetch, with particular id. 
If user input is involved also sending value to service.
